This is a program that finds the time in months it takes for
rabbits to multiply to a population that will dominate the world.

It is a successful solution to a code challenge presented on Reddit
in the subreddit '/dailyprogrammer'.

FIRST-TIME STARTUP:

To run the program we must first have 'node.js' installed on our system.
A link to the downloads for your OS can be found here https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
'Node.js' is a javascript runtime environment and is what we will be using to run the program.

Once installed, we can run 'npm install' in our bash terminal.
This command will install all necessary dependencies found in our 'package.json' file.

When all packages are installed succesfully, we can run the program in our bash terminal
by typing the command 'node execute.js'.

Follow the program instructions to insert your parameters.
Enjoy!!
